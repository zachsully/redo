synopsis: Basic conditional and boolean operators with monadic variants.
description: This library provides:
             .
             * Implementations of various overloaded conditional operations
             .
             * Lifted monadic variants of those operations and common boolean operators
             .
             * A typeclass for boolean algebras.
             .
             Feel free to send ideas and suggestions for new conditional operators to the
             maintainer.
             .
             Monadic looping constructs are not included as part of this package, since the
             monad-loops package has a fairly complete collection of them already.
